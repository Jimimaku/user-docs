# Download and install Broker

Snyk Broker is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/broker) and published as a set of Docker images for specific integrations. If you are using Kubernetes, Snyk provides a [Helm Chart](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-broker-helm) to deploy Snyk Broker. To deploy Broker, you must install and configure an integration.

You can install and configure using [Helm](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-helm.md) or [Docker](install-and-configure-snyk-broker/install-and-configure-broker-using-docker.md). You can install using Docker to run the Snyk Broker Client or run `npm install snyk-broker`. Snyk recommends using Helm as the simplest way to deploy Snyk Broker.&#x20;
