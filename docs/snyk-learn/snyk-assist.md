## How Snyk Assist Works

Snyk Assist utilizes Generative AI to respond to questions based on information retrieved from trusted Snyk sources:

* [Snyk Learn lessons](https://learn.snyk.io/catalog/?format=lesson)
* [Snyk Documentation](../)&#x20;

Snyk Assist **does not** have access to your Snyk tenant data, such as issue and asset information, or Snyk Learn learning history. While interacting with Snyk Assist, we collect and process your queries and conversation history to provide responses and improve our service.&#x20;

The technology leverages Snyk-managed services and selected third-party Large Language Model (LLM) providers to respond with helpful and informative answers.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Capabilities and Limitations**

* Snyk Assist **is designed** to answer questions regarding Snyk functionality and security concepts based on its knowledge base derived from Snyk Learn and Snyk Docs.
* Snyk Assist **does not** perform security analysis, check your code for vulnerabilities, comment on code quality, or provide specific code samples. For code scanning and analysis, continue using the Snyk CLI, Snyk IDE extensions, or recurring SCM tests integrated with your repositories.&#x20;
* Snyk Assist provides information from its body of knowledge, but responses should not be considered legal, security, or compliance advice. While we strive for accuracy, Snyk is not liable for decisions made based on information provided by Snyk Assist. Always verify critical security information through official Snyk documentation and tools.

3. Type your questions about Snyk products or application security concepts into the chat prompt.

Snyk Assist will answer based on its knowledge base, potentially including links to relevant documentation, Learn lessons, and Snyk blogs.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not see the chat icon, your Snyk admin may not have enabled this functionality for your Group. Additionally, ensure that the default Org in your Snyk settings is set to your company's Snyk Org and not a personal Snyk Org.
{% endhint %}
