# Snyk CI/CD Integration deployment and strategies

When you decide to use a Snyk CI/CD Integration, you typically adopt the integration in specific stages and choose a deployment method. See [CI/CD adoption and deployment](ci-cd-adoption-and-deployment.md).

Then, [set up](ci-cd-setup.md) the CI/CD Integration.

You will be using `snyk test` and `snyk monitor` in the CI/CD integration. [See Snyk test and snyk monitor in CI/CD integration](snyk-test-and-snyk-monitor-in-ci-cd-integration.md).

Review the CI/CD strategies for the code you are scanning:

* [Snyk Open Source-specific CI/CD strategies](snyk-open-source-specific-ci-cd-strategies.md)
* [Snyk Container-specific CI/CD strategies](snyk-container-specific-ci-cd-strategies.md)
* [Snyk IaC-specific CI/CD strategies](snyk-iac-specific-ci-cd-strategies.md)

Troubleshooting information and a list of resources are provided; see [CI/CD troubleshooting and resources](ci-cd-troubleshooting-and-resources.md).
