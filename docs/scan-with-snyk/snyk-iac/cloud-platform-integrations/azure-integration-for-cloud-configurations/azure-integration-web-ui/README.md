The steps follow to onboard an Azure subscription to Snyk via the API:

1. [Download an infrastructure as code (IaC) template or Bash script:](step-1-download-azure-app-registration-iac-template-or-script-web-ui.md) to give Snyk permissions to scan your subscription.
2. [Create an Entra ID app registration:](step-2-create-the-entra-id-app-registration.md) using the template or script you downloaded.
3. [Create and scan a Cloud Environment.](step-3-create-and-scan-a-cloud-environment-for-azure-web-ui.md)

When you have completed the steps, you will be able to do the following:

* View the cloud configuration issues Snyk finds. See [Manage cloud issues](../../../getting-started-with-cloud-scans/manage-cloud-issues/).
* Prioritize your vulnerabilities with cloud context.
