# Regional API endpoints

By default, the task uses the [https://api.snyk.io](https://api.snyk.io) endpoint. To configure Snyk to use a different endpoint set a `SNYK_API` environment variable in the pipeline, for example, `https://api.eu.snyk.io`.

Refer to [Configure the Snyk CLI](../../../snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli/) for more information about environment configuration. For more information about regional endpoints, see [Regional hosting and data residency.](../../../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md)
