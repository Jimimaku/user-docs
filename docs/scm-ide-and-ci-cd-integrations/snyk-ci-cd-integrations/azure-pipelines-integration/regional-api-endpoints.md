# Regional API endpoints

By default, the task uses the [https://api.snyk.io](https://api.snyk.io) endpoint. To configure Snyk to use a different endpoint set a `SNYK_API` environment variable in the pipeline, for example, `https://api.eu.snyk.io`.

For more information about environment configuration, see [Configure the Snyk CLI](../../../snyk-cli/configure-the-snyk-cli/). For more details, see the [list of available regions on the Regional hosting and data residency page](../../../working-with-snyk/regional-hosting-and-data-residency.md#available-snyk-regions).

An example follows of  how you can modify the Snyk scan task to use an alternate endpoint:

```
variables:
  SNYK_API: http://api.us.snyk.io/
...

- task: SnykSecurityScan@1
  inputs:
   ...
  env:
    SNYK_API: '$(SNYK_API)'
```
