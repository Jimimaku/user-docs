# Download the CLI with the Eclipse plugin

When you install the Eclipse plugin and open a file that Snyk supports, the [Snyk CLI](../../../snyk-cli/) is downloaded automatically unless you have opted out. The [Language Server](../snyk-language-server/) is also downloaded. The Language Server works with the CLI to give you an optimal Eclipse experience.
