# Candidates for upcoming API end-of-life cadences

This page contains the list of V1, non-GA REST, and older versions of GA REST endpoints that are potential candidates for future end-of-life cadences. To see which endpoints are currently being end-of-life'd, see the [API EOL endpoints and key dates](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/candidates-for-upcoming-api-end-of-life-cadences) page.

If an endpoint is listed in the table below, it does not guarantee that the endpoint will be included in the next end-of-life cadence. In addition, an endpoint can go straight into the next end-of-life cadence without having to be listed in the table below.&#x20;

The endpoints in this list, and in any end-of-life cadence, must adhere to our end-of-life criteria, which require that the endpoints have:&#x20;

* A GA REST equivalent or equivalents (except in the rare case where a V1 API does not have or need a GA REST equivalent)
* Functionality parity between V1 and GA REST (unless explicitly stated otherwise in the migration guide)
* A migration guide by our field specialists for ease of migration

Endpoints that are currently being end-of-life'd will not appear in the list below (as the list is for future candidates for end-of-life), and they can be found in the [API EOL endpoints and key dates](https://docs.snyk.io/api-end-of-life-eol-process-and-migration-guides/candidates-for-upcoming-api-end-of-life-cadences) page.&#x20;
