At the Group level, you can set up and customize your Snyk Essentials integrations from the **Integrations** page where the following SCMs are available:

The Integrations page at the Group level shows all active integrations, including any data automatically synced from your existing Snyk Organizations, and provides access to the Integrations page.

You can use the wildcards while setting up your integration using the Integrations page:

* Open the **Integrations** page.&#x20;
* Select the **SCM** tag and search for GitHub or Azure DevOps.&#x20;
* Click the **Add** button.
* In the **Organizations** field, add the Organization details by using the `*` symbol. For example, using  `*snyk` integrates all SCM Organizations that have Snyk in their name.
