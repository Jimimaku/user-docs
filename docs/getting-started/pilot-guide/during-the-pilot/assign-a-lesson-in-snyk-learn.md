{% include "../../../.gitbook/includes/pilot-guide-toc.md" %}

The Snyk platform includes access to Snyk Learn, the Snyk security education platform. With resources on Snyk Learn, developers can learn how to stay secure through interactive lessons that explore vulnerabilities across various languages and ecosystems.

Throughout the platform, such as in the IDE extensions, PR checks, and Web UI, Snyk links out to relevant lessons in Snyk Learn that help the developer fix that vulnerability. These lessons can also be accessed directly at [learn.snyk.io](http://learn.snyk.io).

Start by navigating to [Snyk Learn](http://learn.snyk.io) and browsing the set of available lessons:
