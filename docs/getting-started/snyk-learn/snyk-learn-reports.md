Snyk Learn Reports allow you to gain insights into which lessons and lesson categories users view for each Organization.

Snyk Learn also provides reports for learning path completion where you can see the users current progress for each available learning path and when they last completed it.

Reporting is available on a per-org basis, showing the Learning Path and Lesson progress for users within that Organization.&#x20;

Lesson progress is associated with the individual user, meaning that if they are members of multiple Organizations, their lesson progress will be the same across all Organizations.

All reports can be downloaded to a CSV file. The Lesson Overview report CSV contains the historical completions and current progress. The Learning Path overview report CSV contains the current learning path progress and the last completion date.

Snyk Learn Reports support Organizations with up to 5000 members.
