# Snyk Platform Access credits

The Snyk Platform Access pricing plan unifies Snyk Code, Open Source, Container, and IaC under a single license to simplify security management. This enables instant deployment and rapid response to security incidents and evolving threats.

This allows you full access to the Snyk platform and to use the credits based on your needs. Any changes to rates, including new products or pricing adjustments, are announced 30 days in advance through the [**Billing and Usage**](../snyk-platform-administration/groups-and-organizations/usage-settings.md#billing-and-usage) dashboard available in the UI for admin users.

For more information on how credits work and the Snyk Platform Access plan, see [Policies](https://snyk.io/policies/definition-of-snyk-platform-access/).
