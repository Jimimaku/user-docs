{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/pilot-guide-toc.md" %}

Provide your Snyk account team with the email of the desired Snyk tenant admin.

Your account team will provision your Snyk tenant, which you will be able to access after receiving a welcome email from Snyk. More details on this process can be found in the [Auto-provisioning guide](../../../../implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/auto-provisioning-guide.md).
