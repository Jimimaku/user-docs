# Configure self-hosted SCM

{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/pilot-guide-toc.md" %}

Use Snyk Broker to integrate with the SCMs that are hosted within a private network. The Snyk Broker is an open-source proxy that connects Snyk with source integrations, enabling snyk.io to scan your code and provide results.

Review the [Snyk Broker documentation](../../../../implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/) and [prerequisites](../../../../implementation-and-setup/enterprise-setup/snyk-broker/classic-broker/prepare-snyk-broker-for-deployment/) before deploying. For more details about setting up the Snyk Broker, contact your Snyk account team.
