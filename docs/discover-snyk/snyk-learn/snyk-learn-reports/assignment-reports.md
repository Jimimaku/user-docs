After you have created your first [Assignments](../snyk-learn-assignments.md) with Snyk Learn, you can use the Assignment reporting to track progress at an organization level. This is useful for team managers, security champions, AppSec engineers and compliance team members to follow up on detailed progress, and to extract reports for compliance usage.

## Assignment Report&#x20;

By navigating to your [assignment](https://learn.snyk.io/admin/assignments/) dashboard, you can find reports showing your organizational progress against assignments.&#x20;

You can also use the filter to drill down further, and the buttons below the filter allow you to change the due date, delete assignments, and also trigger email reminders for your users.
