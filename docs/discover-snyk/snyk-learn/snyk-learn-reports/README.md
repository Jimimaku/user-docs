Snyk Learn offers reports to help you track learning progress across your Snyk tenant.

Snyk Learn offers [organization-level reports](organization-reports.md) to understand on an org by org basis how your teams are engaging with the Snyk Learn content. This is useful for team leads or security champions to track the progress of their teams.&#x20;

You can use the [assignments report](assignment-reports.md) to track individual [Snyk Learn assignments](../snyk-learn-assignments.md).&#x20;

For insights into your overall security education and training program performance and engagement, we have [program reporting](program-reporting.md) available in the Snyk app.
