# Quickstart guides for MCP

To add an MCP server to an Agentic IDE, consult the documentation for the AI system where you plan to integrate Snyk and review the specific MCP instructions.

Examples of systems where you can integrate Snyk include [Windsurf's MCP](https://docs.windsurf.com/windsurf/mcp), [Qodo's MCP support](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-gen/qodo-gen-chat/agentic-mode/agentic-tools-mcps), and [VS Code MCP support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/mcp-servers).

This section includes quickstart guides for use with agentic IDEs.
