# CLI, IDE, and CI/CD integrations

This section of the documentation provides information about the [Snyk CLI](snyk-cli/), [IDE](snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions/), and [CI/CD integrations](../scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ci-cd-integrations/).

Snyk enables you to embed security scanning directly into your development workflow, ensuring code security from your local environment through to your build pipelines. You can achieve this by:

* **Running the Snyk CLI locally:** Test your code for vulnerabilities directly on your machine before committing changes.
* **Utilizing our IDE plugins:** Find and fix security issues in real-time as you code, directly within your integrated development environment.
* **Incorporating scans into your CI/CD pipelines:** Automate security checks as part of your build and deployment processes, catching vulnerabilities before they reach production.

This multi-faceted approach allows you to implement robust security practices at every crucial stage of software development.
