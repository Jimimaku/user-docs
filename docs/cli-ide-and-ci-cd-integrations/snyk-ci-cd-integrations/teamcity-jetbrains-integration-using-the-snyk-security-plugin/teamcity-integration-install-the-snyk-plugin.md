2. Configure the **Plugins list** to **Periodically check for plugin updates**, to ensure regular automatic upgrades in the background.
3. Navigate to the [JetBrains Plugins Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12227-snyk-security), search for Snyk, and, from the **Get** dropdown list, select the plugin for your TeamCity installation.
4. In response to the prompt, click **Install**.
5. When the installation ends, and the **Administration Plugins List** loads with a notification that the plugin has been uploaded, ensure the plugin is enabled.
