# Labeling policy

## Labeling policy

Categorize and label repository assets with [asset labels](../../../../manage-assets/assets-inventory-components.md#labels). You can use the **Set Asset Labels** action to mark the repositories to which the filter criteria you have set apply.&#x20;

Snyk Essentials has a number of pre-defined system labels that can be used for filtering and setting labels with policies. User-defined custom labels can be created using policies. You can create a Set Asset label policy action and define a custom tag by typing your tag in the tag search bar and selecting **Create new: `label_name`**. In this example the `label_name` is payment.

The following use case demonstrates how to apply the custom-defined `backend` label to assets that match certain naming conventions. This allows a quick filter for backend assets from the Inventory view.

This is how the policy should look after you finish setting up all filters and actions.
