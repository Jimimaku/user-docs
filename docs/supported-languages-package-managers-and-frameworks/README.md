Only official releases are tracked. Commits, including into the default branch, are not identified unless included in an official release or tag.&#x20;

In the case of projects that have a package manager, this means a release to the package manager.&#x20;

In the case of Go and Unmanaged scans (C/C++) this requires an official release or tag on the Github repo.
