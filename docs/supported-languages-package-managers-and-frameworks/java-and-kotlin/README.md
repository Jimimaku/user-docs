## Java and Kotlin for Snyk Open Source

For Java and Kotlin with Snyk Open Source, the following file formats are supported:

* For Maven: `pom.xml`
* For Gradle: `build.gradle`, `build.gradle.kts`

Reports are available for Java and Kotlin with Open Source.&#x20;

Available features:

* Reports
* License scanning
* Fix PRs (for Gradle only Fix advice is available)

## Validating, monitoring, alerting, and gating for Java and Kotlin&#x20;

For SCM integrations, Snyk allows you to [run PR Checks](../../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/pull-request-checks/) to validate submitted changes to code and open source packages before merging. Snyk can also retest and alert on the default branch on a scheduled basis. You can see the results on the **Projects** page.

For CI/CD integrations, Snyk can passively monitor and provide a QA gate by failing build checks during testing for policy violations.

Snyk provides flexible capabilities, including:

* [Gradle Plugins](https://snyk.io/blog/gradle-plugin-by-snyk-gradle-dependencies-scanning/) (Community project)
* [Maven Plugins](https://snyk.io/blog/snyk-maven-plugin-integrated-security-vulnerability-scanning-for-developers/)
* Dedicated plugins for Jenkins, Circle CI, and others (see relevant marketplaces)
* Using [Github Actions](https://snyk.io/blog/building-a-secure-pipeline-with-github-actions/)
* The Snyk CLI can be used in most CI/CD systems (see [examples](https://github.com/snyk-labs/snyk-cicd-integration-examples))
  * Fail the build based on criteria using options or the [snyk-filter](../../developer-tools/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/cli-tools/snyk-filter.md) tool
  * There are [containerized](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk) versions available
* With Partner Platforms: Azure, Bitbucket, and AWS have built-in pipes/components for use with Snyk. For Java, Snyk suggests using the SCM integration with Bitbucket Cloud or using the CLI instead of the prepackaged Bitbucket Pipe.

Snyk can monitor container images and their open source or Linux based packages being used in production using Kubernetes integration, to notify customers of known vulnerabilities for applications in production. This feature is available for Enterprise plans only.

Where a production integration does not exist, use the [snyk monitor](../../developer-tools/snyk-cli/commands/monitor.md) CLI command to take a snapshot and monitor what is being pushed to production (available for all plans).

## Java support for BOM

Maven supports [bill of materials (BOM) POM files](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#bill-of-materials-bom-poms) to centralize dependency versions known to work together.

A BOM file includes:

* a `pom` packaging type: `<packaging>pom</packaging>`.
* a `dependencyManagement` section.

Third-party Projects can provide BOM files to make dependency management easier. Here are some common examples:

* [spring-data-bom](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-bom) - The Spring team provides a BOM for their Spring Data Project.
* [jackson-bom](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-bom) - The Jackson Project provides a BOM for Jackson dependencies.

Example of a BOM file:

{% code title="Example 1 - BOM file" %}
```xml
<project ...>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>snyk</groupId>
    <artifactId>snyk-bom</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <packaging>pom</packaging>
    <name>Snyk Bill Of Materials</name>
    
    <dependencyManagement>
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>log4j</groupId>
                <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
                <version>1.2.12</version>
            </dependency>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>commons-logging</groupId>
                <artifactId>commons-logging</artifactId>
                <version>1.1.1</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
    </dependencyManagement>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}

The `dependencyManagement` section contains dependency elements. Each dependency is a lookup reference for Maven to determine the version to select for transitive (and direct) dependencies.

Defining a dependency in the `dependencyManagement` section ia used only for lookup reference, it does not add it to the dependency tree of the Project.

You can run `mvn dependency:tree` on the previous BOM example to show that Maven does not treat the contents as dependencies of the file itself.

This BOM can be imported into a Project POM as a parent. You do not need to specify the `log4j` version, as it inherits it from the BOM:

{% code title="Example 2 - Project POM" %}
```xml
<project ...>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <parent>
        <groupId>snyk</groupId>
        <artifactId>snyk-bom</artifactId>
        <version>1.0</version>
    </parent>
    
    <groupId>snyk</groupId>
    <artifactId>snyk-project</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <packaging>jar</packaging>
    <name>Snyk Project</name>
    
    <dependency>
        <groupId>log4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</project>
```
{% endcode %}

Snyk applies the versions in the BOM `dependencyManagement` lookup to any dependencies declared in Project POMs that import it as a `parent`.

When Snyk scans the BOM files, the `dependencyManagement` contents are not considered dependencies of that file. These are only lookups.

For the previous examples, Snyk analyzes and treats the files as follows:

* BOM file - Snyk does not create a Snyk Project for this file because it has no dependencies.
* Project POM - Snyk creates a Project with a single dependency of `log4j,` with `v1.2.12`. Snyk applies the rules from the parent BOM to identify the correct version for `log4j`. The dependency `commons-logging` is not included, as it is not directly declared in the Project POM.

{% hint style="info" %}
If a BOM has direct dependencies outside `dependencyManagement`, then Snyk creates a Project for that BOM.
{% endhint %}

Snyk also offers fix advice, including recommendations for upgrading vulnerable packages with the [Fix PR feature](../../scan-with-snyk/pull-requests/#snyk-fix-prs).

Fix PRs can only be created for dependencies whose versions are managed in the POM file where the issue is reported.

If the version or dependency is managed in a parent BOM, then even though Snyk sees that it could fix the vulnerable path by changing the version, it cannot apply the fix.
