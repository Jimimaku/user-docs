# TypeScript

In Snyk Open Source, TypeScript is supported in exactly the same way as [JavaScript](javascript/javascript-for-open-source.md).

Refer to the [TypeScript details](snyk-language-support-details.md#typescript) for supported frameworks, libraries, and features.

For information on using the Snyk CLI and IDE and CI/CD for code analysis, see [Snyk CLI for Snyk Code](../snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-snyk-code/).
