### Internal contributor guidelines

If you are an internal Snyk contributor with write access to this repository, you can open a PR to fix issues or make small updates. 
- Use a branch rather than a fork, to allow GitBook previews. This makes it easier for the docs team to review your PR.
- Use the workflow in the #request-ux-content Slack channel to request a review of your PR.
- Your commits must be signed.

For larger updates, we prefer that you make the changes in GitBook. Go to our internal [writing user documentation](https://snyksec.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DRC/pages/1819541615/Writing+user+documentation) page for details. 

To ask questions or to report issues to the user docs team, use the workflow in the #request-ux-content Slack channel to contact us.
